# ForceItemBattle

ForceItemBattle is a gamemode where players compete to collect specific items as quickly as possible. Here's how it works:

When the game starts, every player gets a random item assigned. The goal is to collect as many items as possible in a specified  time. The player who has found the most items at the end of the time limit wins the battle.
