# ForceItemBattle

This config stores all item descriptions for [ForceItemBattle](https://github.com/McPlayHDnet/ForceItemBattle/)

The resourcepack is needed to display the items in the bossbar.

**IMPORTANT**:

if `FIB_Worldgen.zip` is in the plugins folder, you have to add `file/FIB_Worldgen.zip` to server.properties at `initial-enabled-packs=`
